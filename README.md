# Description

Simple web app for integrating with Sreality website developed as test tasks for Luxonisu.

## Installation

### Requirements

1. Installed Docker.
2. Installed Git.

### Installing

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/LWJerri/Sreality`.
2. Move to `Sreality` just type `cd Sreality`.
3. Run `docker compose up -d`.
4. Visit `http://localhost:8080` for frontend or `http://localhost:8081` for API.

### What could be added

I think you could also add more information like location, date of publication and author as well as leave a link to the original site.

### Some important information

1. When checking, use the English-language version of the site, because publications are different.
2. This is also my first time using ReactJS here, but in the future I promise to learn this framework in more detail so that I can complete tasks as efficiently and correctly as possible.
3. I'm still more of a backend developer than a fullstack or frontend developer.
